**Greetings,**
    
**My name is Michael Manteo, I am 21 years old and I am a senior at SUNY New Paltz. I first got interested in computer science in high school, where I took an introductory Java course. When I was a student at SUNY Polytechnic Institute for 2 years, I took computer engineering related courses such as introduction to electric circuits, digital logic, and microprocessor & embedded systems programming. I also took an introductory computer science course that was taught using UNIX and C, as well as a Data Structures & Algorithms class taught in C++. Last fall when I transferred here I took CS:III Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming, which developed my knowledge of data structures using Java. I also took an Assembly Language & Computer Architecture class. In my spare time, I have familiarized myself with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and a tiny bit of MySQL. I have one published website, a static page for my uncle’s piano business, with a basic JavaScript implementation (www.pianooutlet.com). I am currently working on research for an additional webpage for an already published game service website that my friend owns and I did not develop thus far (www.frostboost.com), it uses the PHP framework Code Igniter so I have been spending some time learning it. My GitHub account (www.github.com/michaelmanteo) does not have anything interesting besides my uncle’s published website & some working solutions to some java data structures problems, but I do plan on filling it with new projects in the coming months.**

**I still feel like I have so much to learn in the web programming sphere, so I am very excited to further my understanding with this class and to add additional projects to my personal programming portfolio. I have thus far not studied any other framework in depth besides PHP’s Code Igniter. I am very excited to begin using my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP knowledge and apply it to understanding new frameworks. Immediately after this semester I hope to, in some way, apply my newfound knowledge of these new technologies to help bring www.frostboost.com several new RuneScape service features. In the future I plan on getting a job in web development, while also doing freelance work on the side.**
